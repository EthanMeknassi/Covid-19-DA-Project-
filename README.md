# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes COVID-19 data, focusing on deaths and vaccinations to gain insights and track the impact of the pandemic across different countries and continents.

## Project Overview

Data was collected from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), cleaned, and imported into SQL Server Management Studio. Queries were developed to address specific questions about COVID-19 cases, deaths, and infection rates across various regions. Finally, the analyzed data was visualized in a Tableau Public dashboard.

### Key Objectives

1. **Worldwide Case and Death Statistics:** Calculate the total number of cases and deaths globally, along with the death percentage.
2. **Infection Rate Over Time:** Track the percentage of the population infected over time for selected countries.
3. **Continent-Wise Death Statistics:** Determine the maximum death count per continent.
4. **Country-Wise Infection Rates:** Identify the maximum infection rate for each country.

### Process

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:** 
   - Obtained the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
   - Cleaned and formatted the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. **Database Analysis:** 
   - Imported the cleaned data into SQL Server Management Studio.
   - Developed SQL queries to meet the established objectives. Each query was refined through trial and error to improve accuracy and efficiency.

3. **Data Visualization:** 
   - Uploaded the query results to Tableau Public.
   - Created a dashboard that showcases key findings and insights.
